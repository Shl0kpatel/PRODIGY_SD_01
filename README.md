Title: Temperature Converter

Description:
This Python program is a temperature converter that allows you to convert temperatures between Celsius (C), Fahrenheit (F), and Kelvin (K).

Features:
Supports all three temperature units: Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.
Provides clear user instructions.
Handles invalid input formats and units gracefully.
Usage:

Run the Python script.
Enter the temperature value followed by a space and the unit (e.g., 25 C, 77 F, 300 K).
The program will display the equivalent temperatures in all three units.

Example:
User guide: Enter the temperature value and unit (Please use Celsius (C), Fahrenheit (F), or Kelvin (K)).
For example if you want to enter 25 degrees Celsius then enter 25 C or 25 Celsius
Enter the temperature value and unit : 30 C
Temperature in Kelvin is: 303.15
Temperature in Fahrenheit is: 86.00

Explanation:
The program first prompts the user to enter a temperature value and its unit. It then validates the input format and unit. If the input is valid, it performs the necessary conversion calculations based on the chosen unit and displays the results in all three units.

Additional Notes:
The program uses floating-point numbers to represent temperatures, allowing for decimal values.
The output temperature values are formatted to two decimal places for better readability.
